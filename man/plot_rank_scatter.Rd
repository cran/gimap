\title{Rank plot for target-level GI scores}
\usage{
plot_rank_scatter(gimap_dataset, reps_to_drop = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{gimap_dataset}{A special dataset structure that is originally setup using `setup_data()` and has had gi scores calculated with `calc_gi()`.}

\item{reps_to_drop}{Names of replicates that should be not plotted (Optional)}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 rankplot of the target level genetic interaction scores.
}
\description{
This plot is meant to be functionally equivalent to Fig 5a (for HeLa, equivalent of Fig 3c for PC9).
Rank plot of target-level GI scores.
Dashed horizontal lines are for GI scores of 0.25 and -0.5
