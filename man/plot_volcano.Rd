\title{Volcano plot for GI scores}
\usage{
plot_volcano(gimap_dataset, facet_rep = TRUE, reps_to_drop = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{gimap_dataset}{A special dataset structure that is originally setup using `setup_data()` and has had gi scores calculated with `calc_gi()`.}

\item{facet_rep}{Should the replicates be wrapped with facet_wrap()?}

\item{reps_to_drop}{Names of replicates that should be not plotted (Optional)}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 volcano plot of the target level genetic interaction scores.
}
\description{
This plot is meant to be functionally equivalent to Fig 5b (for HeLa, equivalent of Fig 3d for PC9).
Volcano plot of target-level GI scores
Blue points are synthetic lethal paralog GIs with GI < 0.5 and FDR < 0.1; red points are buffering paralog GIs with GI > 0.25 and FDR < 0.1.
